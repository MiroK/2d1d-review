1. Comment of praciticability of Qcap: how expensive computing the eigenvalues to
  the application of the preconditioner. Compare approaches with time.
2. Comment on other possible preconditioners, e.g. BPX

3. Bullets 3, 4, 5 - fix math
4. Bullet 6 comment on effect epislon in tabs 3.2 and 4.2
5. 3d example
6. Minor fixes (mostly typos)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3., 4., 6. -> okay ...
5. -> no that's a next paper
1. Compare Vcap, Qcap
2. Resarch other preconditioners. We will implement Schur complement (which
realizes the Neuamann to Dirichlet map?) but for the others the comparison will
be in terms of O(f(n, m)) scaling
