1. I give a significant weight to the criticism that one of the two
  preconditioners is potentially impractical due to the need to solve an
  eigenvalue problem.

2. I also agree with the criticism that insufficient details are given on
  computational costs and that larger problems may need to be solved to
  demonstrate efficiency of the proposed preconditioners.  [BOTH]

3. Two months to complete the review. By 9/6/2016
