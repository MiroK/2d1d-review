For the theoretical part two things are needed:
	-r2.3 algrabraic multiplicity like malkus
	-r3.2 and somewhat r2.4 research other preconditioners and their
	 complexity
        - PETSc schur complement preconditioner?

For the computational part:
	->need to get timings for Qcap and Vcap: how much AMG costs to construct
         and apply, (how much CG costs), how much eigenvalue cost, how much
         action of the full preconditioner cost-> answer r2.1, r2.2, r3.1
	-- Then we can make comparison between preconditioners r3.1
        - Implement some third preconditioner
        -- Make comparison -> r3.4
        
    All the above report as some tables with details on sizes and timings r2.5

        -> sizes of problems are not deemed smalll - push serial Ax=b to ~12mil,
        need meshes for that r2.6
        -> iterative eigenvalue solver so that 10^5 is possible and for larger
        CGN
