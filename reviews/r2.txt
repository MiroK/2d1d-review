1. Qcap costly
2. It is necessary to provide a detailed computational cost aanlysis of the
  preconditioners, and especially the Qcap preconditioner
3. I wonder if it would be possible to performa more complete eigevnalue analysis
  of the preconditioned matrix, i.e., to solve the generalized eigenvalue
problem analitically to the extend possible and attempt to reveal algebraic
moltiplicity of the eigenvalues.
4. Sparse in comparison to other effective preconditioning approaches.
5. More info on numerical systems. Sizes, timings
6. Demonstrate efficiency on larger systems
7. 3d example

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1., 2. -> Add timings to Vcap, Qcap preconditioner measuring AMG cstr, AMG
action, CG action (as in precond block), timing action of the preconditioner,
eig solve, eig action

3. -> Attempt this with Malkus

4. -> Add comparision to Schur complement preconditioner, timings and iters

5. -> Okay make tables with timings/sizes info

6. -> The largest problem in serial is ..., gun for 4mil and more

7. -> No that is a next paper
